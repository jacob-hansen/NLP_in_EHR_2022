Units in ms.,"The concentration of Tau Filament in the cerebral spinal fluid, pulled with a lumbar puncture. Measured in micro-Molarity. ",How long the patient is unconscious upon impact and receiving the injury. Longer unconsciousness indicates a more severe case of TBI. Measured in minutes. ,"The location where the head injury occurred. Either front, left side, right side, back, or on top. specifically the location of impact. Location 1-4 moving around the head, and 0 for on top.",The number of days that have elapsed since receiving the injury. ,"A measure of how severe an arm injury is range 0-5.
